# Releasing Prime Agent

The protected GitHub Actions workflows are the only release authority. Local commands may prepare and validate release files, but they never publish packages, create or move tags, push branches, upload artifacts, or promote a release channel.

Prime Agent's supported distribution is the branded R2 tarball bundle installed by `install.sh`. Every release also provides immutable `prime-agent`, `prime-agent-ai`, `prime-agent-core`, and `prime-agent-tui` tarballs for direct SDK and library use. The inherited npm workspace names are source-level implementation details.

## Release Contract

A stable version consists of:

- immutable objects under `releases/vX.Y.Z/`;
- an immutable `release-provenance.json` binding the channel, source SHA, artifact names, and SHA-256 values;
- an immutable `vX.Y.Z` Git tag and matching GitHub Release assets;
- the `/stable` text pointer used by existing installers;
- `/latest.json`, the stable commit marker used by update checks.

Beta uses the same versioned R2 object rules, plus the mutable `/beta`, `/beta.json`, `beta` tag, and beta prerelease compatibility surfaces. Installers continue to read the text pointers, while running clients read the JSON manifests. Do not remove or change either shape without a separate compatibility plan.

The root release-control version and these four packaged workspaces are lockstep:

- `packages/agent`
- `packages/ai`
- `packages/coding-agent`
- `packages/tui`

Private and example workspaces are not release packages and must remain untouched. Prime Agent supports patch and minor releases while the major version remains zero.

## Prepare a Release Pull Request

Start from a clean feature branch after reviewing every affected package's changelog fragments under `packages/<pkg>/.changes/`. Run one of:

```bash
pnpm run release:prepare -- patch
pnpm run release:prepare -- minor
pnpm run release:prepare -- 0.8.1
```

The command updates only the root release-control manifest, the four packaged manifests, internal dependency ranges, corresponding lockfile metadata, and those four changelogs. It folds non-empty fragments into the dated release sections, removes the consumed fragment files, and restores the original files if any replacement or fragment removal fails. It does not stage or commit the result.

Review the complete diff. Confirm that each changelog release section contains the expected fragments, consumed fragments were removed, private/example manifests did not change, and the lockfile contains only expected version and internal-range changes.

Build the candidate using the normal repository build process, then run the non-publishing validation:

```bash
pnpm run release:dry-run
pnpm run release:test
pnpm run check
```

`release:dry-run` packages into a temporary directory, validates tarball names, compatibility manifests, and the source-SHA provenance manifest, verifies every SHA-256 digest and internal R2 URL, and removes its output. It has no npm, GitHub Release, Git tag, Git push, or R2 publication path.

Open and review the release-preparation pull request. Merging the exact version-preparation commit to the protected default branch is the only way to introduce a new production candidate.

## CI Publication

The Release Prime Agent workflow starts only after the canonical `CI` workflow completes successfully for a same-repository push to the protected default branch. It binds every checkout, workflow artifact, manifest, and checksum to that CI run's complete source SHA. After its aggregate gate succeeds, it uploads one run-scoped publication context containing the exact source SHA, protected tooling SHA, versions, channel flags, and release run ID.

The separate Publish Prime Agent release workflow is loaded only from the protected default branch and starts only after a Release Prime Agent run completes. Only successful runs whose event metadata already matches the exact workflow path, repository, and default branch enter the shared publication lock; rejected runs use isolated groups. Before any protected mutation job, the workflow verifies the conclusion, event, run ID, tooling SHA, and complete context schema, then downloads artifacts only from that validated run. Each successful default-branch commit builds a beta; production is additionally published only when the root version changed to a strictly newer validated version.

The upstream CI result already covers the complete Node and locked Python suites. A protected production retry invokes the same reusable CI workflow against the immutable tag SHA before rebuilding or publishing. Failed, cancelled, skipped, fork-originated, wrong-branch, wrong-workflow, and wrong-SHA results cannot reach publication.

The production transaction is ordered as follows:

1. Resolve and validate the exact version, commit, lockfile, package manifests, changelogs, and existing tag state using the protected workflow commit's release tooling.
2. Build, check, run the release lifecycle tests, pack once, and validate the workflow artifacts without publication credentials.
3. Create or verify the immutable version tag and GitHub Release target using only GitHub credentials.
4. Create missing versioned R2 objects using conditional writes in a separate R2-only phase. Existing objects must be byte-identical.
5. Upload missing GitHub Release assets in a GitHub-only phase. Existing assets must be byte-identical and are never clobbered.
6. Verify all versioned R2 and GitHub Release objects.
7. Upload and verify the stable and beta installer scripts.
8. Write and verify `/stable`.
9. Write and verify `/latest.json` last.

The workflow serializes publication and refuses to move either stable surface backward: the effective monotonic floor is the higher version named by `/stable` or `/latest.json`. Only the protected rollback workflow may lower both surfaces. GitHub mutations run in dedicated write-token jobs, while R2 jobs have only a read token and receive R2 credentials at the individual mutation step. Beta freshness is rechecked inside each mutable GitHub, installer, and pointer phase immediately before its first write.

## Retry

After the immutable `vX.Y.Z` tag exists, a maintainer with repository `admin` or `maintain` permission can post this exact issue comment:

```text
/prime-agent release retry vX.Y.Z
```

The `issue_comment` event always loads workflow code from the protected default branch; branch-selectable release dispatches and tag-push publication are not supported. The workflow derives both the version and commit from the tag, verifies that it belongs to the default branch, reruns the complete reusable CI suite at that SHA, and rebuilds the exact tagged source. Release policy, the locked Python test environment, and publication scripts come from the protected workflow commit in separate checkouts, so tags created before this lifecycle was introduced remain retryable. A free-form version paired with current `main` is not supported.

If the original production run failed before creating the version tag, rerun that exact failed workflow run instead. Do not use a later default-branch run or create the tag locally. Once the immutable tag exists, use the issue-comment retry command for subsequent recovery attempts.

Retries are idempotent:

- a failure before tag creation has no release state;
- an empty release or partially uploaded immutable set can be completed by retry;
- identical existing R2 and GitHub Release objects are reused;
- a missing provenance manifest on a pre-migration release may be added without rewriting its existing compatibility manifest or artifacts;
- any existing object with different bytes hard-fails;
- if `/stable` advanced but `/latest.json` did not, retry completes the JSON commit marker.

Never delete or replace an immutable version tag or artifact to make a retry pass. Investigate the mismatch and prepare a new version.

## Rollback

Prefer a forward fix. If stable must be restored immediately, a maintainer with repository `admin` or `maintain` permission can post this exact two-line issue comment:

```text
/prime-agent release rollback vX.Y.Z
ROLLBACK vX.Y.Z
```

The default-branch workflow and an API-derived maintainer permission are the repository-enforced authorization boundary. Authorization, exact command parsing, tag resolution, and default-branch ancestry checks complete in an ungated preflight job before the workflow can acquire the shared release lock or enter the `production` environment, so an unauthorized comment cannot block publication. The authorized tag commit is carried across the protected wait and must still match before any asset is accepted. The mutation job targets the `production` environment, so configured environment reviewers provide an additional gate but are not assumed to exist. A GitHub-read-only phase downloads and validates the immutable Release assets; a separate R2-only phase verifies the matching remote objects before writing `/stable` and then `/latest.json`. It does not create or move tags, rewrite immutable objects, or change GitHub Releases.

Rollback changes what fresh installations and future update checks select. It does not force already-installed newer clients to downgrade.

## Retired Commands

The inherited `release:*`, `version:*`, root `publish`, root `publish:dry`, and `scripts/sync-versions.js` paths intentionally hard-fail. They previously operated on unrelated workspaces, npm publication, local commits and tags, and direct pushes to `main`. Do not restore or bypass them.

`release:pack` remains internal non-publishing packaging machinery used by the dry run and CI.
